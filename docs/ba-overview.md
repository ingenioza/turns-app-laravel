# BA / Product Overview (Laravel + Inertia v2)

## Problem
Groups need a simple, fair system to decide “who’s next” and remember over time, including notifications and web access for leaders.

## Users
- Ad‑hoc users via mobile app (Flutter) or quick web.
- Persistent groups (family/team/class) managed via the web UI.

## Core Value
- Leader can manage groups, algorithms, and notifications via web.
- Persistent history and fairness analytics.
- Optional auth ensures continuity across devices.

## MVP Outcomes
