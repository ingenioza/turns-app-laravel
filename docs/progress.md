  - [x] TurnApiTest: 14 tests covering turn lifecycle + authorization
  - [x] FirebaseAuthTest: 9 tests for authentication flow

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Authorization System
- **Spatie Laravel Permission** v6.21.0 installed and configured
- **Role-based access control** with graceful fallback for tests
- **Policy-driven authorization** on all controllers

- **Pivot tables** for group memberships with roles and turn order
- **Soft deletes** for groups and turns
- **Timestamps** for created_at/updated_at tracking

### API Architecture
- **Thin controllers** with authorization calls
- **Repository pattern** for data access
- **Resource transformations** for consistent API responses
- **Sanctum authentication** with Firebase token exchange

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Phase: Phase 3 - Algorithms & Turns

Ready to implement turn assignment algorithms and services.

## ðŸ§ª Test Coverage Summary
- **Unit Tests**: 8 tests (basic model functionality)  
- **Feature Tests**: 33 tests (API endpoints, auth, business logic)
